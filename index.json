Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining, or single-cell sequencing is usually not available such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing. We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools for estimating a variety of immune cell types from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ~11,000 cells from the tumor microenvironment to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, which allowed us to measure the accuracy of the computational methods. Moreover, we collected publicly available data that provide both RNA-seq and independent, gold-standard estimates of the cell type proportions. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of a hundred of thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across computational methods over ten cell types and ~1,400 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined high-quality signatures, demonstrating its practical utility of bulk RNA-seq to dissect immune-cell composition of tumor samples. In addition to guidelines for method selection (depending on the cell types of interest) we also offer an R package to allow the community to perform integrated deconvolution using different methods themselves (https://grst.github.io/immunedeconv). We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures.","tags":["single-cell","cell-type deconvolution","tumor microenvironment","cancer immunology"],"title":"Comprehensive evaluation of cell-type quantification methods for immuno-oncology","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541458800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541458800,"objectID":"77dc0160beae851647e9f4659a4f7e77","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/talk/bioc2018/","publishdate":"2018-11-06T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/bioc2018/","section":"talk","summary":"The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis motivates the existence of so-called sponges, i.e., genes that exert strong regulatory control via miRNA binding in a ceRNA interaction network.

METHODS: A total of80 glioblastoma patients (40/group) were included in a matchedpair analysis. One group (carmustine wafer group) receivedconcomitant chemoradiotherapy with carmustine wafer implantation(Stupp protocol). The second group (control group) received onlyconcomitant chemoradiotherapy. All tumor specimens were subjectedto evaluations of miRNA-181d expression, results were correlatedwith further individual clinical data. The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) dataset of 149 patients was used as an independent cohortto validate the results. RESULTS: Patients in the carmustinewafer group with low miRNA-181d expression had significantlylonger overall (hazard ratio [HR], 35.03, [95% confidenceinterval (CI): 3.50-350.23], P = .002) and progression-freesurvival (HR, 20.23, [95% CI: 2.19-186.86], P = .008) thanpatients of the same group with a high miRNA-181d expression.These correlations were not observed in the control group.

Recently, H19 was shown to be regulated under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, aim of this study was to determine the function of H19 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), an inflammation-associated type of tumor. In four different human HCC patient cohorts H19 was distinctly downregulated in tumor tissue compared to normal or non-tumorous adjacent tissue. We therefore determined the action of H19 in three different human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Plc/Prf5, and Huh7). Clonogenicity and proliferation assays showed that H19 overexpression could suppress tumor cell survival and proliferation after treatment with either sorafenib or doxorubicin, suggesting chemosensitizing actions of H19. Since HCC displays a highly chemoresistant tumor entity, cell lines resistant to doxorubicin or sorafenib were established. In all six chemoresistant cell lines H19 expression was significantly downregulated. The promoter methylation of the H19 gene was significantly different in chemoresistant cell lines compared to their sensitive counterparts. Chemoresistant cells were sensitized after H19 overexpression by either increasing the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin or decreasing cell proliferation upon sorafenib treatment. An H19 knockout mouse model (H19Δ3) showed increased tumor development and tumor cell proliferation after treatment with the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) independent of the reciprocally imprinted insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). In conclusion, H19 suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis, hepatoma cell growth, and HCC chemoresistance. Thus, mimicking H19 action might be a potential target to overcome chemoresistance in future HCC therapy.","tags":["cancer","long non-coding RNA","chemoresistance"],"title":"The long non-coding RNA H19 suppresses carcinogenesis and chemoresistance in hepatocellular carcinoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Alcaraz","Markus List","Richa Batra","Fabio Vandin","Henrik J Ditzel","Jan Baumbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504216800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504216800,"objectID":"43805a5fa9edc8cd0128c23f1bcb0825","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/alcaraz-2017-zg/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alcaraz-2017-zg/","section":"publication","summary":"Gene expression profiles have been extensively discussed as anaid to guide the therapy by predicting disease outcome for thepatients suffering from complex diseases, such as cancer.However, prediction models built upon single-gene (SG) featuresshow poor stability and performance on independent datasets.Attempts to mitigate these drawbacks have led to the developmentof network-based approaches that integrate pathway informationto produce meta-gene (MG) features.

While a large number of commercial productsis available, small- to mid-sized laboratories can often notafford the costs or are concerned about the longevity of theproviders. Turning towards free alternatives, however, raisesquestions about data protection, which are not sufficientlyaddressed by available solutions. To serve as legal documents,ELNs must prevent scientific fraud through technical means suchas digital signatures. It would also be advantageous if an ELNwas integrated with a laboratory information management system toallow for a comprehensive documentation of experimental workincluding the location of samples that were used in a particularexperiment. Here, we present OpenLabNotes, which addsstate-of-the-art ELN capabilities to OpenLabFramework, a powerfuland flexible laboratory information management system. Incontrast to comparable solutions, it allows to protect theintellectual property of its users by offering data protectionwith digital signatures. OpenLabNotes effectively closes the gapbetween research documentation and sample management, thus makingOpen-LabFramework more attractive for laboratories that seek toincrease productivity through electronic data management.","tags":["functional genomics","LIMS","electronic laboratory notebook","web application"],"title":"OpenLabNotes - An Electronic Laboratory Notebook Extension for OpenLabFramework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Ines Block","Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Mads Thomassen","Qihua Tan","Jan Baumbach","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1406844000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406844000,"objectID":"6edcda9a1e3c71f23942b8c53778df28","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-qf/","publishdate":"2014-08-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-qf/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["LIMS","protein array","functional genomics","high-throughput screening","web application"],"title":"Microarray R-based analysis of complex lysate experiments with MIRACLE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Steffen Schmidt","Jakub Trojnar","Jochen Thomas","Mads Thomassen","Torben A Kruse","Qihua Tan","Jan Baumbach","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393628400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393628400,"objectID":"1cef86f0fa1483467f6c92537b5b4126","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-dd/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-dd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["LIMS","functional genomics","web application"],"title":"Efficient Sample Tracking With OpenLabFramework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Anne-Christin Hauschild","Qihua Tan","Torben A Kruse","Jan Mollenhauer","Jan Baumbach","Richa Batra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"75db4810db948839bc789267605a198e","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-ae/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-ae/","section":"publication","summary":"Selecting the most promising treatment strategy for breast cancercrucially depends on determining the correct subtype. In recentyears, gene expression profiling has been investigated as analternative to histochemical methods. Since databases like TCGAprovide easy and unrestricted access to gene expression data forhundreds of patients, the challenge is to extract a minimaloptimal set of genes with good prognostic properties from a largebulk of genes making a moderate contribution to classification.Several studies have successfully applied machine learningalgorithms to solve this so-called gene selection problem.However, more diverse data from other OMICS technologies areavailable, including methylation. We hypothesize that combiningmethylation and gene expression data could already lead to alargely improved classification model, since the resulting modelwill reflect differences not only on the transcriptomic, but alsoon an epigenetic level. We compared so-called random forestderived classification models based on gene expression andmethylation data alone, to a model based on the combined featuresand to a model based on the gold standard PAM50. We obtainedbootstrap errors of 10-20% and classification error of 1-50%,depending on breast cancer subtype and model. The gene expressionmodel was clearly superior to the methylation model, which wasalso reflected in the combined model, which mainly selectedfeatures from gene expression data. However, the methylationmodel was able to identify unique features not considered asrelevant by the gene expression model, which might provide deeperinsights into breast cancer subtype differentiation on anepigenetic level.","tags":["cancer subtyping","multi-omics integration","biomarker discovery"],"title":"Classification of Breast Cancer Subtypes by combining GeneExpression and DNA Methylation Data","type":"publication"}]
