[{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"To address the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis, drug repurposing is an attractive approach that offers new therapeutic options through the identification of alternative usages for already approved drugs. Numerous research groups around the world are working on treatment options for COVID-19 and are joining efforts to identify drugs that can be repurposed. A promising strategy for identifying drugs is to use network and systems medicine approaches, which provide a comprehensive understanding of the infection mechanisms while not only focussing on the virus and its direct interaction partners, but also including the host protein interaction network. To aid in COVID-19 related drug repurposing, the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics organized a hackathon to develop CoVex, a network and systems medicine platform that integrates virus-human interaction data for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. CoVex supports researchers in interactive network medicine analysis, where they can bring in their expert knowledge to identify putative drug targets and drug repurposing candidates.\nMore information: https://www.exbio.de/exbio-vs-covid-part-1 The CoVex platform: https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/covex Animation video:\n ","date":1587679200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587679200,"objectID":"83ed04186bba6d0c1ec27a3f5acf1a8e","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/post/covex/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/covex/","section":"post","summary":"The CoVex systems medicine platform allows identifying putative drug targets and drug repurposing candidates to treat COVID-19.","tags":["COVID-19","Sars-CoV-2","hackathon","systems medicine","network medicine","drug repurposing"],"title":"The fight against COVID-19","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julia Mergner","Martin Frejno","Markus List","Michael Papacek","Xia Chen","Ajeet Chaudhary","Patroklos Samaras","Sandra Richter","Hiromasa Shikata","Maxim Messerer","others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583881200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583881200,"objectID":"7314533d9c8c286e8462f806c40c58c0","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/mergner-2020-mass/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mergner-2020-mass/","section":"publication","summary":"Plants are essential for life and are extremely diverse organisms with unique molecular capabilities1. Here we present a quantitative atlas of the transcriptomes, proteomes and phosphoproteomes of 30 tissues of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analysis provides initial answers to how many genes exist as proteins (more than 18,000), where they are expressed, in which approximate quantities (a dynamic range of more than six orders of magnitude) and to what extent they are phosphorylated (over 43,000 sites). We present examples of how the data may be used, such as to discover proteins that are translated from short open-reading frames, to uncover sequence motifs that are involved in the regulation of protein production, and to identify tissue-specific protein complexes or phosphorylation-mediated signalling events. Interactive access to this resource for the plant community is provided by the ProteomicsDB and ATHENA databases, which include powerful bioinformatics tools to explore and characterize Arabidopsis proteins, their modifications and interactions.","tags":["cell-type deconvolution","tumor microenvironment","DNA methylation","cell type heterogeneity"],"title":"Mass-spectrometry-based draft of the Arabidopsis proteome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olga Lazareva","Hoan Van Do","Stefan Canzar","Kevin Yuan","Jan Baumbach","Paolo Tieri","Tim Kacprowski","Markus List"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577833200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577833200,"objectID":"9eb9418bde71f3432e99a9855c416b9c","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/lazareva-2020-bicon/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lazareva-2020-bicon/","section":"publication","summary":"**Motivation** Unsupervised learning approaches are frequently employed to identify patient subgroups and biomarkers such as disease-associated genes. Thus, clustering and biclustering are powerful techniques often used with expression data, but are usually not suitable to unravel molecular mechanisms along with patient subgroups. To alleviate this, we developed the network-constrained biclustering approach BiCoN (Biclustering Constrained by Networks) which (i) restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and (ii) maximizes the difference in gene expression between two subgroups of patients.\n\n**Results** Our analyses of non-small cell lung and breast cancer gene expression data demonstrate that BiCoN clusters patients in agreement with known cancer subtypes while discovering gene subnetworks pointing to functional differences between these subtypes. Furthermore, we show that BiCoN is robust to noise and batch effects and can distinguish between high and low load of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes while identifying subnetworks related to immune cell function. In summary, BiCoN is a powerful new systems medicine tool to stratify patients while elucidating the responsible disease mechanism.","tags":["cell-type heterogeneity","patient stratification","systems medicine","network enrichment"],"title":"BiCoN: Network-constrained biclustering of patients and omics data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Alcaraz","Anne Hartebrodt","Markus List"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577833200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577833200,"objectID":"32ea4776d8ecba8efc6f836ef0f6becb","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/alcaraz-2020-novo/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alcaraz-2020-novo/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["de novo pathway enrichment"],"title":"De Novo Pathway Enrichment with KeyPathwayMiner","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David B Blumenthal","Lorenzo Viola","Markus List","Jan Baumbach","Paolo Tieri","Tim Kacprowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577833200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577833200,"objectID":"2dffa3151e306763a4eac6e173459c26","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/blumenthal-2020-epigen/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/blumenthal-2020-epigen/","section":"publication","summary":"Simulated data is crucial for evaluating epistasis detection tools in genome-wide association studies.

Most studies are limited to the average DNA methylation levels of individual CpGs and thus neglect heterogeneity within the profiled cell populations. To assess this within-sample heterogeneity (WSH) several window-based scores that quantify variability in DNA methylation in sequencing reads have been proposed. We performed the first systematic comparison of four published WSH scores based on simulated and publicly available datasets. Moreover, we propose two new scores and provide guidelines for selecting appropriate scores to address cell-type heterogeneity, cellular contamination and allele-specific methylation. Most of the measures were sensitive in detecting DNA methylation heterogeneity in these scenarios, while we detected differences in susceptibility to technical bias. Using recently published DNA methylation profiles of Ewing sarcoma samples, we show that DNA methylation heterogeneity provides information complementary to the DNA methylation level. WSH scores are powerful tools for estimating variance in DNA methylation patterns and have the potential for detecting novel disease-associated genomic loci not captured by established statistics. We provide an R-package implementing the WSH scores for integration into analysis workflows.","tags":["cell-type deconvolution","tumor microenvironment","DNA methylation","cell type heterogeneity"],"title":"Quantitative comparison of within-sample heterogeneity scores for DNA methylation data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tarek Kröhler","Sonja M.

Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining or single-cell sequencing are often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing.*Results*We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ∼11 000 cells from the TME to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and ∼1800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets.

Individual miRNAs may regulate hundreds of genes, giving rise to a complex gene regulatory network in which transcripts carrying miRNA binding sites act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Several methods for the analysis of ceRNA interactions exist, but these do often not adjust for statistical confounders or address the problem that more than one miRNA interacts with a target transcript.*Results* We present SPONGE, a method for the fast construction of ceRNA networks. SPONGE uses ’multiple sensitivity correlation’, a newly defined measure for which we can estimate a distribution under a null hypothesis. SPONGE can accurately quantify the contribution of multiple miRNAs to a ceRNA interaction with a probabilistic model that addresses previously neglected confounding factors and allows fast P-value calculation, thus outperforming existing approaches. We applied SPONGE to paired miRNA and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for studying global effects of miRNA-mediated cross-talk. Our results highlight already established and novel protein-coding and non-coding ceRNAs which could serve as biomarkers in cancer.*Availability and implementation*SPONGE is available as an R/Bioconductor package (doi: 10.18129/B9.bioc.SPONGE).","tags":["miRNA regulatoin","competing endogeneous RNA","gene regulation","systems biology"],"title":"Large-scale inference of competing endogenous RNA networks with sparse partial correlation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Sippl","Ralf Ketter","Lisa Bohr","Yoo Jin Kim","Markus List","Joachim Oertel","Steffi Urbschat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546297200,"objectID":"f12c7d0e46ff375fa5323949f6d2b070","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/sippl-2019-mirna/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sippl-2019-mirna/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"MiRNA-181d expression significantly affects treatment responses to carmustine wafer implantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sonja Kessler","Kevan Hosseini","Tarek Kroehler","Ahmad Barghash","Sonika Patial","Jessica Hoppstaedter","Katja Gemperlein","Johannes Haybaeck","Markus List","Rolf Mueller"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546297200,"objectID":"bea8958954b91705b9a558630eed349a","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/kessler-2019-thu/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kessler-2019-thu/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"THU-470-The mRNA-binding protein tristetraprolin promotes hepatocarcinogenesis but inhibits tumour progression in liver cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1545001200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545001200,"objectID":"c1e6f0d2029222755c35a6ae7f0197f8","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/talk/imm/","publishdate":"2018-12-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/imm/","section":"talk","summary":"The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis motivates the existence of so-called sponges, i.e., genes that exert strong regulatory control via miRNA binding in a ceRNA interaction network.

While a large number of commercial productsis available, small- to mid-sized laboratories can often notafford the costs or are concerned about the longevity of theproviders. Turning towards free alternatives, however, raisesquestions about data protection, which are not sufficientlyaddressed by available solutions. To serve as legal documents,ELNs must prevent scientific fraud through technical means suchas digital signatures. It would also be advantageous if an ELNwas integrated with a laboratory information management system toallow for a comprehensive documentation of experimental workincluding the location of samples that were used in a particularexperiment. Here, we present OpenLabNotes, which addsstate-of-the-art ELN capabilities to OpenLabFramework, a powerfuland flexible laboratory information management system. Incontrast to comparable solutions, it allows to protect theintellectual property of its users by offering data protectionwith digital signatures. OpenLabNotes effectively closes the gapbetween research documentation and sample management, thus makingOpen-LabFramework more attractive for laboratories that seek toincrease productivity through electronic data management.","tags":["functional genomics","LIMS","electronic laboratory notebook","web application"],"title":"OpenLabNotes - An Electronic Laboratory Notebook Extension for OpenLabFramework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Ines Block","Markus List","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"53c3457d5163cba8538cea56638520e9","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/pedersen-2015-reverse/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pedersen-2015-reverse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reverse Phase Protein Arrays for High-throughput Toxicity Screening","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Ines Block","Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Mads Thomassen","Qihua Tan","Jan Baumbach","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1406844000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406844000,"objectID":"afb0a3510f20f78a4708f2bdd0a587a8","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-microarray/","publishdate":"2014-08-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-microarray/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["LIMS","protein array","functional genomics","high-throughput screening","web application"],"title":"Microarray R-based analysis of complex lysate experiments with MIRACLE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Steffen Schmidt","Jakub Trojnar","Jochen Thomas","Mads Thomassen","Torben A Kruse","Qihua Tan","Jan Baumbach","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393628400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393628400,"objectID":"cd5128493ec3b0348deb023bfeb20ccc","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-efficient/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-efficient/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["LIMS","functional genomics","web application"],"title":"Efficient Sample Tracking With OpenLabFramework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Anne-Christin Hauschild","Qihua Tan","Torben A Kruse","Jan Mollenhauer","Jan Baumbach","Richa Batra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"d3b35476a4dbe27c354badb376acb14e","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-classification/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Selecting the most promising treatment strategy for breast cancercrucially depends on determining the correct subtype. In recentyears, gene expression profiling has been investigated as analternative to histochemical methods. Since databases like TCGAprovide easy and unrestricted access to gene expression data forhundreds of patients, the challenge is to extract a minimaloptimal set of genes with good prognostic properties from a largebulk of genes making a moderate contribution to classification.Several studies have successfully applied machine learningalgorithms to solve this so-called gene selection problem.However, more diverse data from other OMICS technologies areavailable, including methylation. We hypothesize that combiningmethylation and gene expression data could already lead to alargely improved classification model, since the resulting modelwill reflect differences not only on the transcriptomic, but alsoon an epigenetic level. We compared so-called random forestderived classification models based on gene expression andmethylation data alone, to a model based on the combined featuresand to a model based on the gold standard PAM50. We obtainedbootstrap errors of 10-20% and classification error of 1-50%,depending on breast cancer subtype and model. The gene expressionmodel was clearly superior to the methylation model, which wasalso reflected in the combined model, which mainly selectedfeatures from gene expression data. However, the methylationmodel was able to identify unique features not considered asrelevant by the gene expression model, which might provide deeperinsights into breast cancer subtype differentiation on anepigenetic level.","tags":["cancer subtyping","multi-omics integration","biomarker discovery"],"title":"Classification of Breast Cancer Subtypes by combining GeneExpression and DNA Methylation Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Ines Block","Markus List","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"e3b74b5f600cd5cb485cd42761f05848","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/pedersen-2014-integrated/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pedersen-2014-integrated/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Integrated Automation of High-Throughput Screening and Reverse Phase Protein Array Sample Preparation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Ines Block","Markus List","Leena Karimi","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"6d301ada913c8670db9a886d543d16c6","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/pedersen-2014-reverse/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pedersen-2014-reverse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reverse Phase Protein Arrays for High-Throughput Protein Measurements in Mammospheres","type":"publication"}]
