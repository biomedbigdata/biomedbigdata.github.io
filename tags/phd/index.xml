      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Ph.D. student in the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TU Munich. In 2015, I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics in Moscow, and after some time in the industry, I moved to Rome to do an MSc in Data Science at La Sapienza University of Rome. There I participated in many projects related to Machine Learning, Data Mining, Bayesian Statistics and Signal Processing. In the second year of my studies, I became particularly instead in Graph Machine Learning Techniques and its application to Network Biology.</description>
