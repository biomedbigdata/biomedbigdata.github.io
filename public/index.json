This poses a powerful disease mechanism that disrupts parts of the cellular transcriptional program through one or few key sponge genes. In particular in cancer, non-coding RNAs may facilitate changes in transcriptional programs without the risk of lethal side effects caused by expressing a protein at abnormally high or low levels. In spite of the importance of this phenomenon, we currently lack an efficient method for inferring sponge interactions on a genome-wide scale. Moreover, confounding factors such as large differences in sample numbers prevent comparisons across different cancer cohorts. This motivated us to develop sparse partial correlation on gene expression (SPONGE), a method that is orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches and allows for the construction of genome-wide ceRNA interaction networks. SPONGE is the first method to compute empirical p-values efficiently based on a series of null models and can thus control for confounding factors that were underestimated in previous studies. SPONGE enabled us to build the most comprehensive set of genome-wide ceRNA regulation models for 22 cancer types based on miRNA and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Since SPONGE accounts for confounding factors, we could perform pan-cancer analyses and reveal hundreds of novel sponge genes. In particular non-coding genes appear suitable as survival markers in different cancer types. Our results highlight the relevance of ceRNA network inference for clinical research, in particular considering the potential of targeting disease-associated non-coding RNAs in personalized medicine.","tags":[],"title":"Guest Lecture at CeMM","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Florian Schmidt","Markus List","Engin Cukuroglu","Sebastian Köhler","Jonathan Göke","Marcel H Schulz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536357600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536357600,"objectID":"0327b999f897880c4fdd3961054d49aa","permalink":"/publication/ontology_eval/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ontology_eval/","section":"publication","summary":"International consortia such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or the International Human Epigenetics Consortium (IHEC) have produced a wealth of genomic datasets with the goal of advancing our understanding of cell differentiation and disease mechanisms. However, utilizing all of these data effectively through integrative analysis is hampered by batch effects, large cell type heterogeneity and low replicate numbers. To study if batch effects across datasets can be observed and adjusted for, we analyze RNA-seq data of 215 samples from ENCODE, Roadmap, BLUEPRINT and DEEP as well as 1336 samples from GTEx and TCGA. While batch effects are a considerable issue, it is non-trivial to determine if batch adjustment leads to an improvement in data quality, especially in cases of low replicate numbers. We present a novel method for assessing the performance of batch effect adjustment methods on heterogeneous data. Our method borrows information from the Cell Ontology to establish if batch adjustment leads to a better agreement between observed pairwise similarity and similarity of cell types inferred from the ontology. A comparison of state-of-the art batch effect adjustment methods suggests that batch effects in heterogeneous datasets with low replicate numbers cannot be adequately adjusted. Better methods need to be developed, which can be assessed objectively in the framework presented here.","tags":[],"title":"An ontology-based method for assessing batch effect adjustment approaches in heterogeneous datasets","type":"publication"}]
