      <description>I am a master student in Bioinformatics at TUM and LMU in Munich and recently joined the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics to work on my Master’s thesis. My aim is to provide an additional functionality to KeyPathwayMiner, the lab’s network enrichment tool, by implementing a p-value based approach. Previously, I have worked with omics and health care data.</description>

      <description>I am a master student in Bioinformatics with a research interest in Epigenetics and Immuno-Oncology. In my master thesis I am collaborating with Pieris Pharmaceuticals in Freising and Prof. Zlatko Trajanoski&amp;rsquo;s Lab in Innsbruck to better understand the functional orientation of immune cells in the tumor micro-environment. In a previous project, I co-developed BioQC, a method for assessing gene expression data for tissue heterogeneity.</description>

      <description>I am a Bioinformatics Bachelor student at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Technical University of Munich since October 2017. Currently I am working as a HiWi at the Experimental Bioinformatics chair at the Technical University to gather more practical experience. My current project is focused on tackling issues with meta data and batch effects in the International Human Epigenome Consortium.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Bachelor student in Bioinformatics at the Technical University of Munich and the LMU since 2017. I&amp;rsquo;m working at the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics in Weihenstephan as a HiWi. In my current project I implement new features into the web version of KeyPathwayMiner, with the goal to make it more efficient and user-friendly as well as to implement new features suggested by the community.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Ph.D. student in the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TU Munich. In 2015, I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics in Moscow, and after some time in the industry, I moved to Rome to do an MSc in Data Science at La Sapienza University of Rome. There I participated in many projects related to Machine Learning, Data Mining, Bayesian Statistics and Signal Processing. In the second year of my studies, I became particularly instead in Graph Machine Learning Techniques and its application to Network Biology.</description>
